* Provides interactive dashboards for inventory trends, forecasted demand, and risk alerts.

* Supports data-driven decision-making for hospital administrators and supply chain managers.

* Automates monitoring of stock levels to reduce costs and prevent shortages.

## Technologies Used
* Frontend: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn-ui

* Backend & Analytics: Node.js, Python (for ML & data processing)

* Data Handling: SQL, pandas, NumPy

* Visualization: Tableau, matplotlib

* Tooling: Vite, npm


## Usage
* Upload historical supply, usage, and patient data.

* Run predictive models to forecast supply demand.

* Visualize results through interactive dashboards and risk alerts.

* Use insights to guide inventory management and reduce costs.

## Impact
* Improved operational efficiency by predicting supply needs accurately.

* Reduced stockouts and overstocking in hospitals.

* Enabled data-driven decision-making for healthcare administrators.

* Enhanced patient care outcomes by ensuring critical supplies are available.
